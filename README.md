# Information Field Theory Research Repository

Welcome to the Information Field Theory (IFT) Research Repository. This repository contains our work exploring alternative methods for inferring the moments of non-Gaussian continuous random fields using techniques derived from Information Field Theory.

## Overview

In various fields like physics, astronomy, and engineering, many problems involve continuous random fields that exhibit spatial and temporal variations. While Gaussian random fields are well-understood and can be analyzed by inferring their mean and variance, non-Gaussian fields present significant challenges due to the computational complexity involved in traditional inference methods.

This project focuses on:

- **Alternative Inference Methods**: Developing and applying diagrammatic expansion techniques from Information Field Theory to compute the moments of non-Gaussian fields more efficiently.
- **Bayesian Inference Challenges**: Addressing the difficulties in calculating the evidence term in Bayes' theorem for continuous, non-parameterized fields.
- **Reducing Computational Complexity**: Providing methods that are less computationally intensive than traditional techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), especially as the number of parameters increases.
- **Application to Practical Problems**: Extending these techniques to practical cases such as linear regression models and exploring their effectiveness.

## Key Components

- **Diagrammatic Expansion Technique**: Utilizing a method that represents posterior moments as an infinite sum of diagrams, each corresponding to specific equations based on their structure.
- **Hamiltonian Formalism**: Adopting concepts from statistical mechanics, such as the Gibbs measure and partition function, to reformulate the inference problem.
- **Perturbatively Non-Gaussian Fields**: Focusing on fields that deviate slightly from Gaussian distributions, making them suitable for perturbative methods.

## Future Work

- **Higher-Dimensional Applications**: Extending the techniques to fields defined over continuous, higher-dimensional spaces.
- **Basis Functions**: Investigating the use of basis functions to improve computational efficiency and simplify calculations.
- **Broader Distribution Testing**: Exploring the applicability of these methods to other named distributions beyond the Gaussian case.

## Conclusion

This repository aims to provide valuable insights and tools for researchers dealing with the complexities of non-Gaussian continuous random fields. By leveraging Information Field Theory and diagrammatic expansions, we strive to develop more efficient and scalable inference methods that overcome the limitations of traditional computational techniques.
